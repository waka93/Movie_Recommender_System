# RecommenderSystem
Steps of data preprocessing from MovieLens:
1. download https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
2. unzip to a directory that is in the same root directory of this project folder
    The file system layout should be like:
    /project - mk-100/
           \ RecommenderSystem/

3. Inside RecommenderSystem/, run the Preprocessing.ipynb in the jupyter notebook
4. copy mk-100/DATA to RecommenderSystem/
    now all the original data is saved in /DATA directory
